Change db.properties with your details in order to use the database you want.
Use importDatabaseEasy and access the file with the code. It will generate generate the database needed for the project.
If importDatabaseEasy does not work, I have all 6 files separated (create tables, import the 5 tables) in separated files. Try that as well.
